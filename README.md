# RiskZone

## Problem

The situation right now is that being close to other people makes you more likely to catch the Covid-19 virus. 

Using public transport services means you are forced to accept the risk.

We have identified at least three stakeholders.

Users of public transport, including the driver, lack the feeling of control, not knowing how to control the spread of the virus. 

There is a statistically bigger chance to avoid getting sick if you have enough information to make smart decisions while moving from A-B

The government can't fully guide the behavior of its citizens and their awareness of the virus.
If they had enough information to real time movement data they could enable a safer flow of people.

Transportation services are already cutting down on buses, trams and metros. 
Having enough information they could provide ”safer” paths for their users and protect their drivers.

## Solution

We aim to deliver a solution that creates awareness of the current public transportation situation using 
a real time mobility map consisting of higher and lower risk zones. 

It should not be a stand alone solution but building of current infrastructure eg. SJ/ SL / Västtraffik apps.
It would connect data from multiple available public transportation services API, devices you are close to 
and demographic data. We could potentially use Erlang for the technical set-up but we will investigate our options. 
It should be user friendly, of course.
